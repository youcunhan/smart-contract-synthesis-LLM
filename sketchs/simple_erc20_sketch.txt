Here's the contract sketch based on your specifications:

```
// Global Safety Specifications:
// G1: totalSupply >= 0 (always non-negative)
// G2: For all addresses a, balances[a] >= 0 (non-negative balances)
// G3: sum(balances) == totalSupply (conservation of tokens)

contract Token {
    // State Variables
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    // Events
    event Mint(address indexed minter, uint256 amount);
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    
    // Functions
    
    /**
     * @dev Mints new tokens
     * Pre: amount > 0
     * Post: totalSupply == old(totalSupply) + amount
     * Post: balances[msg.sender] == old(balances[msg.sender]) + amount
     */
    function mint(uint256 amount) external;
    
    /**
     * @dev Transfers tokens to another address
     * Pre: balances[msg.sender] >= amount
     * Pre: to != address(0) (non-null address)
     * Post: balances[msg.sender] == old(balances[msg.sender]) - amount
     * Post: balances[to] == old(balances[to]) + amount
     * Post: totalSupply unchanged
     */
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external;
    
    // Note: Would likely include SafeMath for arithmetic operations in implementation
    // Note: Would likely include address(0) checks in implementation
}
```

Key points:
1. Added global invariants for non-negative balances and token conservation
2. Added standard events for token operations
3. Included implicit preconditions (like non-zero address)
4. Added post condition for mint that updates sender's balance
5. Noted where SafeMath would be used in implementation
6. Maintained all specified pre/post conditions while adding necessary ones for safety
