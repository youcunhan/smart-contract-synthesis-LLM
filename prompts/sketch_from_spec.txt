Given the following local and global specifications for a smart contract (LaTeX/math notation is allowed):

Local specifications (for each function): pre/post conditions describing intended state updates.
Global safety specifications: invariants or constraints that must hold across all reachable states and execution traces.

Generate a contract sketch in the standard format, including:
- Contract name
- State variables
- Structs
- Events
- Function definitions, each annotated with its pre/post conditions
- All global safety specifications clearly marked at the top or in a dedicated section
- If needed, include calls to external contracts or libraries (e.g., SafeMath, ERC20) to satisfy the specifications.

Do not generate full Solidity code, only the sketch structure.

Input specifications:
{spec}

Output the sketch in plain text.
